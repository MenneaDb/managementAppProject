# managementAppProject

This is my fist commit of my new project. It is a management app that will allow a group of people to share task and keep track of task. It is provided a private
account and the information will be store in a Firebase databse as the task that the users will create and share with the rest. In this branch I have created the
1st Ui that is a Splash activity that displayed a fullcreen mode with the name of the app and it will be finish() after 2,5 seconds and move to the 2nd UI that is 
the IntroActivity.  

This activity will give the option of sign-in or sign-up the user and it will be connected to the database.
